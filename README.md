# Diabetes-Prediction

## Project Overview

- Preprocessed and cleaned the data (handled nulls, removed duplicates, standardized features)
- Used `train_test_split` to divide the dataset for training and testing
- Trained multiple classification models and finalized SVM based on best accuracy
- Achieved **77% accuracy** on the test dataset
- Data visualizations created using Seaborn and Matplotlib for better insights

## Tech Stack

- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **IDE/Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

The dataset was taken from Kaggle and contains anonymized medical records.  
**Link:** [Kaggle â€“ Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)

## Folder Structure

* Diabetes_Prediction_Using_SVM.ipynb
